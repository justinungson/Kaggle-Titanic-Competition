## First we must convert the character variables into factor variables so that we can fit our model.

## From the mapping of missing data, we can see that the "Cabin" variable is missing too many records for any
## accurate imputation methods. The "Age" variable is also missing data (around 20% for the nearly 900 records).
## We could just take the mean (29.7) or median (28.0) age value but we may be albe to use a more refined imputation
## methodology by taking advantage of the titles of each individual.

get.title <- function(data) {
  title.start <- regexpr("\\,[A-Z ]{1,20}\\.", data$Name, TRUE)
  title.end <- title.start + attr(title.start, "match.length")-1

## The "Embarked" variable contains 2 missing values. We can impute the data with the most common point of
## departure (Queenstown)

train.data$Embarked[which(is.na(train.data$Embarked))] <- "Southampton"

## Perform some basic exploratory analysis to get a better feel for the data and how to best model the predictions

table(train.data$Survived, train.data$Sex)
qplot(Survived, data = train.data) + facet_wrap(~ Sex)
prop.table(table(train.data$Survived, train.data$Sex), 2)

## From the basic exploratory analysis, we can see that most passengers died. Sex was the biggest single predictor of survival with 
## 75% of women survivng while only 19% of men survived. There also seemed to be a weak correlation between passenger class (Pclass)
## and survival. Create child, mother, and family variables. From anecdotal evidence of the era, we can infer that women and children,
## particularly mothers and their children, are the most likely to have survived. 

train.data["Child"] <- NA
for (i in 1:nrow(train.data)) {
  if (train.data$Age[i] <= 12) {
    train.data$Child[i] <- 1
  } else {
    train.data$Child[i] <- 0
  }
}
train.data$Child <- factor(train.data$Child)
levels(train.data$Child) <- c("Not Child", "Child")

train.data["Mother"] = NA
for(i in 1:nrow(train.data)) {
  if(train.data$Title[i] == "Mrs" & train.data$Parch[i] > 0) {
    train.data$Mother[i] = 1
  } else {
    train.data$Mother[i] = 0
  }
}
train.data$Mother <- factor(train.data$Mother)

train.data["Family"] = NA
for(i in 1:nrow(train.data)) {
  x = train.data$SibSp[i]
  y = train.data$Parch[i]
  train.data$Family[i] = x + y + 1
}

## Next, we look at outliers in the data. The "Fare" variable has a mean of 32.2 and a max of 512.30. The minimum fare for the trip is 
## 0 which could indicate that the passenger was a baby or toddler.

subset(train.data, Fare < 10) [order(subset(train.data, Fare < 10)$Fare, subset(train.data, Fare < 10)$Pclass),
                                     c("Age", "Title", "Pclass", "Fare", "Survived")]

train.data$Fare[which(train.data$Fare == 0)] <- NA

impute.median.fare <- function(impute.var, filter.var, var.levels) {
  for (v in var.levels) {
    impute.var[which(filter.var == v)] <- impute(impute.var[which(filter.var == v)])
  }
  return(impute.var)
}
train.data$Age <- impute.median.fare(train.data$Fare, train.data$Pclass, as.numeric(levels(train.data$Pclass)))
